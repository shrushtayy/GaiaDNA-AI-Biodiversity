🌿 GaiaDNA – AI-Powered Biodiversity Discovery Platform

GaiaDNA is a modular AI platform designed to detect **ghost species**, predict **biodiversity hotspots**, and support **conservation science** using ecological datasets.  
It works with **fungi**, **insects**, and can be extended to any organism group with coordinate and taxonomic data.

🚀 Features

🔍 Ghost Species Detection
- Automatically identifies samples where genus exists but species is missing.
- Flags unknown or blank species entries as potential *ghost species*.

🌱 Environmental Feature Generation
- Auto-generates missing environmental variables using:
  - Temperature  
  - Precipitation  
  - Elevation  
  - Soil pH  
  - Vegetation index  
  - Humidity  
  - Seasonality  

 🧠 AI Discovery Potential Prediction
- Random Forest model predicts high-potential areas for undiscovered species.
- Environmental variables automatically scaled and processed.

 🗺️ Interactive Maps (Folium)
- Ghost species hotspot maps  
- Conservation priority regions  
- AI-based discovery heatmaps
