# GaiaDNA-AI-Biodiversity
Revolutionizing biodiversity discovery with AI. GaiaDNA finds and prioritizes undiscovered species before they go extinct using eDNA and machine learning.

🍄 GaiaDNA: AI-Powered Ghost Species DiscoveryA Hackathon MVP built in 48 Hours🎯 Project OverviewGaiaDNA is an Artificial Intelligence solution developed to solve the critical "Ghost Species" problem in biodiversity. We transform raw environmental DNA (eDNA) data—specifically from the Fungi_dataset.csv—into actionable conservation intelligence.By combining incomplete genetic records with geo-spatial environmental data, our AI model predicts the exact micro-climates where undocumented species are most likely to exist, providing a data-driven roadmap for field researchers.👻 The Problem: The Invisible 28%The Fungi_dataset.csv contains over 13,000 fungal eDNA records. A significant portion of these records lacks information in the species column, even though the genus and location are known. These missing records represent "Ghost Species"—life forms that are scientifically invisible, undocumented, and therefore unprotected.Data GapCountPercentageConservation StatusIdentified Species (Species present)~9,75571.7%Known, potentially protectedGhost Species (Species missing)~3,84528.3%Unknown, unprotectedOur model's target was to classify the environmental profile of a location as either a Ghost Site (1) or an Identified Site (0).🛠️ The Solution: The Predictive PipelineOur MVP pipeline focuses on rapid data enrichment and model deployment, allowing conservationists to get a Ghost Probability Score for any new location.1. Data Enrichment (Feature Engineering)We appended critical geo-spatial data to every sample using the decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude fields from the Fungi_dataset.csv.FeatureDescriptionImportance RankTemperatureMean Annual Temperature#1 PredictorElevationAltitude in meters#2 PredictorPrecipitationMean Annual Rainfall#3 PredictorSoil pHSoil acidity/alkalinity#4 Predictor2. AI Model & ArchitectureWe utilized a Random Forest Classifier for its balance of high predictive accuracy and essential feature interpretability.Model Goal: To learn the unique environmental 'signature' that distinguishes a Ghost Habitat from a well-documented one.3. Hackathon PerformanceThe model delivered robust classification metrics, confirming its viability as a tool for targeted field research:MetricResultInsightOverall Accuracy87.2%High certainty in classification.Recall (Ghost Class)79.1%Measures ability to find all actual Ghosts (Most critical metric).Precision (Ghost Class)84.5%Minimizes false positives (wasted expeditions).🚀 Getting Started (Run the MVP)PrerequisitesPython 3.8+GitLocal InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/gaia-dna.git](https://github.com/your-username/gaia-dna.git)
cd gaia-dna
Create and activate the environment:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate

This will open the GaiaDNA Dashboard MVP in your web browser, allowing you to:View the map of known and predicted Ghost Species.Use the input form to get a real-time Ghost Probability Score for a new location.🔮 Future Scope (Scaling the Impact)This MVP demonstrates a powerful proof of concept. Next steps include:Real-time Data Integration: Hooking into global APIs (e.g., NASA, Copernicus) for continuous, live environmental data updates.Model Expansion: Extending the predictive power beyond Fungi to all kingdoms of life (e.g., plants, insects).Public API: Creating a lightweight, accessible API endpoint for conservation agencies to integrate our prediction scores directly into their workflow.GaiaDNA is a blueprint for proactive, optimized conservation, built on the power of AI.
